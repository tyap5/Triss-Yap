	<h1>Teacher's Identity</h1>
		<p1>A significant body of research reveals that students, especially nonwhite students, tend to benefit from having teachers who look like them. In this student opinion question, we asked students how these studies compared with their own experiences in school. While the data did resonate with many commenters, the majority agreed with another premise of the article - that no matter their race or gender, the best teaches are those who care about and believe in their students.</p1>
