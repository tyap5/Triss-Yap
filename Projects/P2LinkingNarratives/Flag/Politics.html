	<h2>Student Opinions: Politics</h2>

	<h3>Abdoul, Philadelphia</h3>
		<p1>"I think that the Pieces of a Flag drawing is trying to show us the effects the bad things that are going on in the US. Those people are breaking apart our country piece by piece until there is nothing left like a puzzle. They are attacking various states which is why some stars are being removed and some former colonies. And by attacking it doesn't mean using brute force. Things like racism could be attacking the country or political decisions."</p1>

	<h3>Sam, Providence, RI</h3>
		<p1>"This image can be viewed in two ways. The first way, which is the way I saw it initially, is people taking the American flag apart. Seeing it like this, it makes me think the illustration is saying how the country is being divided apart due to all the politics and differences in opinion everyone has. On the other hand, you can also view it as people putting the flag together. Seeing it like this, to me, represents how everyone puts their own 'special recipe' into the melting pot of America."</p1>

	<h3>Jasmine Moran, Providence, RI</h3>
		<p1>"When I initially saw this image, it looked to me as though people were uniting to put our flag back together. I began to think of all of the events that have occurred within the past couple of years: mass shootings, political debates, natural disasters, hate-crimes. All of these events have allowed our nation to realize the importance of reuniting our once great country. Some may say that the image depicts people taking apart our flag. While events such as political debates and hate crimes have occurred and caused us to unite, they have also driven us apart. In my opinion, I'd rather look at this image in a postive light and say that it shows our nation's citizens putting America back together again."</p1>
