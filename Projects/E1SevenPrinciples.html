	<div id="introduction">
		<p>In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, <br> Carl Dair showed how in typography, as in music, harmony <br> and contrast are the keys to composition.</p>

		<p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great <br> typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may <br> have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of <br> typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and <br> designed, he managed to describe -- and show -- the ways <br> in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>

		<p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say "typographer": <br> someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter, but <br> someone who uses type, in all its variations, as the principle <br> element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of <br>typography requires a designer who cares about the words <br>themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and is skillful <br> enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve <br> as simply eye-catching decoration.</p>

		<p>Carl Dair's book "<em>Design With Type</em>" (originally published in 1952; <br> revised and expanded in 1967) is deservedly still in print, even <br> though the technology that he used and described has long been <br> outdated. The practicalities of setting type in metal are no longer <br> the practicalities we have to deal with; but the visual relationships <br> between letters, which Dair showed and explained so graphically <br> in his book, haven't changed at all. "<em>Design With Type</em>" is still one <br> of the best handbooks available for learning how to do exactly <br> what the title says: design with type.</p>

		<p>At around the same time he was revising his book, Carl Dair was <br> producing a series of six pamphlets for West Virginia Pulp and <br> Paper (Westvaco), which he called "<em>A Typographic Quest</em>." Each <br> booklet was, naturally, printed on Westvaco paper stock; like the <br> lavish paper-company samples produced today, this series was <br>meant to raise the profile of the manufacturer and encourage <br>designers to think of Westvaco when specifying paper for their <br>printing jobs. But these were quite modest productions: little <br>saddlestitched booklets of about 30 pages, measuring 5-1/4 <br> inches by 9, usually printed in two colors (the first one uses <br> three colors throughout; the later ones are two-color, although <br> the second color may change from sheet to sheet, with all <br> three colors used together on the covers). The first <br> "<em>A Typographic Quest</em>" was published in 1964; the sixth (and, <br> as far as I know, final) came out in 1968, the year Carl Dair died. <br> Since he was both writer and designer for the series, each of <br> the booklets emerged as a wholly crafted object, dedicated to <br> explaining one or another aspect of using type.</p>

		<h2>Harmony and Contrast</h2>

			<p>Graphic form and musical form have a common denominator: <br>rhythm and emphasis, harmony and contrast. "Harmony and <br>Contrast," says Dair, "are fundamental to both, and the discovery <br> of these basic principles and their application to the design of <br> printed matter is the object of this volume of '<em>A Typographic Quest</em>.'"</p>

		<h2>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h2>
		<style>
			h2 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
				text-align: center;
			}
		</style>

		<p>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship <br> between the black strokes of the letters on a page and the space <br> around them; and any rules, frames, or decorations being similar in <br> style to the type), then goes on to show seven different kinds of contrast. <br> He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation, it's important to make <br> the contrast obvious -- not just a slight change, an almost imperceptible <br> variation, but a really big, obvious difference between the contrasting elements.</p>

			<li>Constrast of Size</li>
			<li>Contrast of Weight</li>
			<li>Contrast of Form</li>
			<li>Contrast of Structure</li>

	<div id="subtopic one">
		<h3>Contrast of Size</h3>
			<style>
				h3 {
					font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
					font-size: 25px;
					text-align: center;
				}
			</style> 
				<p>The first and most basic contrast is size. "A simple but dramatic <br> contrast of size," says Dair, "provides a point to which the reader's <br> attention is drawn. Set in the same style of type, it maintains the <br> exact relationship of the letter to the background. It is only a <br> physical enlargement of the basic pattern created by the form <br> and the weight of the type being used for the text." The most <br> common use of size is in making the title or heading noticeably <br> bigger than the text -- but that's only a starting-point.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="subtopic two">
		<h3>Contrast of Weight</h3>
		<style>
			h3 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
				text-align: center;
			}
		</style> 
			<p>The second most obvious contrast is of weight: bold type stands <br> out in the middle of lighter type of the same style. As Dair points <br> out, "Not only types of varying weight, but other typographic <br> material such as rules, spots, squares, etc., can be called into <br> service to provide a heavy area for a powerful point of visual <br> attraction or emphasis."</p>

			<p>The next two kinds of contrast are the contrast of form and the <br> contrast of structure. It's not entirely obvious where to draw a <br> line between these two, since they both have to do with the <br> shapes of the letters.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="subtopic three">
		<h3>Contrast of Form</h3>
		<style>
			h3 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
				text-align: center;
			}
		</style> 
			<p>By "form," Dair means the distinction between a capital letter and <br> its lowercase equivalent, or a roman letter and its italic variant. <br> He includes condensed and expanded versions under "form," <br> and he even allows as how "there are some script types <br> which harmonize with standard types, such as the Bank Script <br> and Bodoni on the opposite page, and can be used for dramatic <br> change of form." (He warns, parenthetically, against using scripts <br> and italics together, since they are both versions of handwritten <br> letters; they're more likely to conflict than to contrast).</p>
	</div>

	<div id="subtopic four">
		<h3>Contrast of Structure</h3>
		<style>
			h3 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
			}
		</style> 
			
			<p>By "structure," Dair means the different letterforms of different <br> kinds of typefaces -- a monoline sans serif vs. a high-contrast <br> modern, for instance, or an italic vs. a blackletter. "The use of <br> contrast of structure may be compared to an orator who <br> changes his voice not to increase or decrease the volume, <br> but to change the very quality of his voice to suit his words."</p>
	</div>

	<div id="subtopic five">
		<h3>Contrast of Texture</h3>
		<style>
			h3 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
			}
		</style> 
			<p>Put all these things together, and apply them to a block of text <br> on a page, and you come to the contrast of texture: the way the <br> lines of type look as a mass, which depends partly on the <br> letterforms themselves and partly on how they're arranged. <br> "Like threads in cloth," says Dair, "types form the fabric of our <br> daily communication."</p>
	</div>

	<div id="subtopic six">
		<h3>Contrast of Color</h3>
		<style>
			h3 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
			}
		</style> 
			<p>Dair's sixth contrast is color -- and he warns that a second color <br> is usually less emphatic than plain black on white (or white on <br> black), so it's important to give careful thought to which element <br> needs to be emphasized, and to pay attention to the tonal values <br> of the colors used.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="subtopic seven">
		<h3>Contrast of Direction</h3>
		<style>
			h3 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
			}
		</style> 
			<p>The last of Dair's seven kinds of contrast is the contrast of direction: <br> the opposition between vertical and horizontal, and the angles in <br> between. Turning one word on its side can have a dramatic effect on <br> a layout. But Dair points out that text blocks also have their vertical <br> or horizontal aspects, and mixing wide blocks of long lines with tall <br> columns of short lines can also produce a contrast.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="topic three">
		<h2>Other Types of Contrast</h2>
		<style>
			h2 {
				font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;
				font-size: 25px;
			}
		</style> 
			<p>The last of Dair's seven kinds of contrast is the contrast of direction: <br> the opposition between vertical and horizontal, and the angles in <br> between. Turning one word on its side can have a dramatic effect <br> on a layout. But Dair points out that text blocks also have their <br> vertical or horizontal aspects, and mixing wide blocks of long lines <br> with tall columns of short lines can also produce a contrast.</p>

			<p>Finally, Dair takes time to say a little about rhythm ("in typography, <br> it consists of intervals of space") and about the power of "interrupted <br> rhythm" ("the impact derives not from the fact that the unexpected <br> happens, but rather that the expected does not happen").</p>

			<p>Most of the time, we use more than one kind of contrast together, <br> in order to make the differences between visual elements even <br> more obvious. We can use all of Dair's seven kinds of contrast at <br> once, if we're skillful; he refers to this as typographic "chords." (One <br> of the chapter titles in "Design With Type" is "Multiplying the Contrasts"). <br> But breaking them down like this into simple oppositions makes it <br> easier to use them consciously; it keeps us from getting our layouts <br> all muddied up through trying to change too many things at once <br> without thinking about what we're doing. I've found Carl Dair's analysis <br> of typographic contrast -- and especially the visual flair with which <br> he presents it -- an invaluable tool in the practice of graphic design.</p>
